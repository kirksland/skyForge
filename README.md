# ☀️ SkyForge 1.8.6-beta

SkyForge is a comprehensive package designed to streamline both USD/Solaris pipeline management and SOP modeling workflows:

1. **USD/Solaris Pipeline**: Tailored for collaborative workflows, it simplifies versioning, department and layer management, and enables batch exports, multi-shot handling, batch rendering, and render cloning. SkyForge helps manage complex projects more efficiently, whether you're working solo or as part of a team.

2. **SOP Modeling**: Features contextual tools that prevent overly complex hierarchies and tangled networks. With keyboard shortcuts, mouse gestures, and radial menus in the viewer, SkyForge enhances modeling and retopology workflows, making them more intuitive and efficient.
